    intersection(s1, s2)
Find intersection point of segment `s1` and `s2`. If no such point is found,
return `nothing`.

Line segments are defined at endpoints 
so linesegments e.g. sharing endpoints are said to intersect, unless they are parallell.
Parallell line segments are defined as not intersecting even if they overlap.

Since we are using floatingpoint numbers the calculations are not 100% accurate. Thus
there is a chance the algorithm will report parallel segments as intersecting
